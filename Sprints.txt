Map data to an SVG window *
Get Data to show up as emojis
Get data to show up as random emojis
get data to cluster *
get data to animate cluster *

Working with plain original data:
    I can use d3.range.map to turn the number into whatever I want: ie. an random emoji
    I want to select the specific data set after simply importing the whole data set.
    1 function that takes in the data and parses it depending on what I need it for:
        if conditionals!
        if femaleA => give it a certain coordinate
        if maleA => give it a certain coordinate, and so on
    Toggles should change the function to use either A, B, or C depending on the year.
    That could be a variable passed into the function, depending on the radio button clicked.


Need to label label label!
Think about hovering?
Think about React site
